-- NM

lowercase letter are static function, can only be called from within a file
uppercase letter are external function, can be called from anywhere as long as the object exist

mach_header->ncmd the size of the segment header. aka "ncmd * segment_command"

nm symbols are sorted by ascii
address must be shown when symbols are within the binary

nlist symbol data

n_strx == offset + symtab_cmd.stroff
---
n_type defines the letter
U == N_UNDF
A == N_ABS
T == N_SECT + section __text
D == N_SECT + load_command __DATA
B == N_SECT + section __bss
C == N_SECT + section __common?
S == N_SECT + none of the above
lower case version N_EXT == 0
---
n_sect == section number
n_desc == for debugging maybe ?
n_value == offset in file

-- OTOOL
for otool -t
just dump segment_header with __TEXT
